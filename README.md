# Computational Physics and Machine Learning: Project 2

This repository contains scripts to solve partial differential equations with the Euler method and neural networks.
Moreover, a neural network algorithm is used to solve an eigenvalue problem. This repository was setup for project 2 of the lecture Computational Physics and Machine Learning.
## More information
* [Task Description](documentation/project_task.pdf)
* Scripts for Euler Solver can be found [here](PDE_Solver_Euler)
* Scripts for Neural Network Solver can be found [here](PDE_Solver_Neural)
* Scripts for Eigenvalue Problem Solver can be found [here](Eigen_Solver)

## How to setup (for Euler Solver)
1. Create conda environment
```python
conda create --name compsci_project_2 --file requirements.txt
```
2. Run one of the following lines depending on your use case.
```python
# if you only want to run the code
python setup.py install
# if you want to change some scripts later
python setup.py develop
```
